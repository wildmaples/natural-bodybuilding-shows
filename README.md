## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Ruby 3.4.4+
- Bundler gem

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd natural-bodybuilding-shows
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. **Create database directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p db
   ```

4. **Initial data scrape** (includes historical data):
   ```bash
   bin/scrape all
   ```

5. **Generate sample past shows** (for demonstration):
   ```bash
   ruby bin/create_sample_past_shows
   ```

## üéØ Usage

### Running the Web Application

```bash
# Development
ruby app.rb

# Production with background process
nohup ruby app.rb > app.log 2>&1 &
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:4567`

### Manual Scraping Operations

```bash
# Scrape all federations (current shows only)
bin/scrape all

# Scrape specific federation
bin/scrape wnbf
bin/scrape ocb

# Scrape historical shows (when available)
ruby bin/scrape_historical

# Create sample past shows for testing
ruby bin/create_sample_past_shows
```

### Web Interface Navigation

1. **Home Page** (`/`):
   - Tab-based navigation: "Upcoming Shows" and "Past Shows"
   - Advanced search and filtering options
   - Real-time result updates
   - Show details with federation badges

2. **About Page** (`/about`):
   - Project information
   - Federation details with official links
   - Usage instructions

3. **Health Check** (`/health`):
   - JSON API endpoint for monitoring
   - Data freshness status
   - Application health metrics

## üõ†Ô∏è API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Response |
|----------|--------|-------------|----------|
| `/` | GET | Main show listing with tabs | HTML |
| `/about` | GET | About page with federation info | HTML |
| `/health` | GET | Health check and status | JSON |

### Health Check Response
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "last_updated": "2025-06-19 12:30:00 -0400",
  "data_stale": false
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Automated Scraping Process
1. **Daily Schedule**: Runs at 6 AM using `rufus-scheduler`
2. **Archive Completed Shows**: Moves past events to historical archive
3. **Parallel Federation Scraping**: OCB and WNBF scraped concurrently
4. **Data Validation**: Ensures scraped data integrity
5. **Historical Updates**: Weekly refresh of historical archives

### Data Flow
```
Federation Websites ‚Üí Scrapers ‚Üí Archive Past Shows ‚Üí Save Current Shows ‚Üí Web Interface
```

### Archival System
- **Pre-Scrape Archive**: Before scraping new data, completed shows are archived
- **Date-Based Logic**: Shows with dates < today are moved to archive
- **Historical Files**: Archived shows saved to `*_historical_events_*.yml`
- **Archive Merging**: New archived shows merged with existing historical data

## üìÅ Data Structure

### Current Shows Files
```yaml
# db/ocb_events_2025-06-19.yml
events:
  "Show Name":
    date: 2025-07-15
    location: "City, State"
    url: "https://registration-link.com"
    federation: "OCB"
```

### Historical Shows Files
```yaml
# db/ocb_historical_events_2025-06-19.yml
events:
  "Completed Show":
    date: 2025-01-15
    location: "City, State"
    url: "https://registration-link.com"
    federation: "OCB"
    archived_on: 2025-06-19
```

4. **Monitoring**: Set up health check monitoring
5. **Logging**: Configure log rotation for `app.log`

### Docker Deployment (Optional)
```dockerfile
FROM ruby:3.4.4
WORKDIR /app
COPY Gemfile* ./
RUN bundle install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 4567
CMD ["ruby", "app.rb"]
```

PORT=4567
```

## üß™ Development & Testing

### Development Setup
```bash
# Install development dependencies
bundle install

# Run with auto-reload
ruby app.rb

# Test scrapers individually
ruby -r ./lib/scrape_ocb.rb -e "puts OcbScraper.new.scrape_events.count"
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test archival functionality
ruby -e "require './lib/scrape_ocb'; OcbScraper.new.send(:archive_completed_shows)"

# Verify data loading
ruby -r ./app/shows.rb -e "s = Shows.new; puts 'Upcoming: #{s.upcoming_count}, Past: #{s.past_count}'"
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Class Loading Errors**:
- Ensure `load` statements are used instead of `require_relative` in `app.rb`
- Restart the application completely if methods aren't recognized

**Missing Past Shows**:
- Run `ruby bin/create_sample_past_shows` to generate sample data
- Check for `*_historical_events_*.yml` files in `db/` directory

**Search Not Working**:
- Verify JavaScript is enabled in browser
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure proper data attributes in HTML

**Scraping Failures**:
- Check `app.log` for detailed error messages
- Verify federation website accessibility
- Test network connectivity
